# AWSTail

[AWSTail](https://gitbuh.com/yorodm/awstail) is a tail like tool for [AWS Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

## **WARNING**

This repository is a work in progress!!! I'm using this tool to get familiar
with the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) language. If you really need a CLI interface
to Cloudwatch you should consider using [the official cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
or [awslogs](https://github.com/jorgebastida/awslogs)
